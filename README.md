# JavaScript Crash Course | Welcome Guide

First of all, welcome to the 3d Edition of our Javascript Crash Course! This is going to be a challenging but exciting journey for getting started on the programming world. 

On this guide we will go through all the steps and tools you will need to get ready for the classes. Please, make sure that you have all the tools installed and ready to go before starting the course.

> If it's the first time you hear about these tools, specially reading some of the guides we will share to get started, you might feel a bit overwhelmed sometimes, as some of the concepts you won't understand them or it will be a lot of new information at once. Please bear with us! :bear: Just try to get the main concept, and contact us with any doubts or problems you encounter during the process (later we will explain how to be in touch with us during the course).

We will provide iOS and Windows tools information on this guide. If you use another systems like Linux, and you don't find the download links or enough information, please get in touch with us.

## Chrome

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) will be the browser of choice, due to its complete developer integrated tools. Make sure that you have the latest version installed on your computer.

## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/) is the messaging tool that we use to communicate during the course:  [iOS Download](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/downloads/mac) | [Windows download](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/downloads/windows). 

Important :speaker:: Get your personal invite to our WTM slack workspace typing your email [here](https://slack.wtmberlin.com/).

On our `#js-crash-course` channel you will be able to ask questions, get support and share the link of your homework so we can review it and give you feedback. 

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) we will use during the course. In simpler words, is the tool that will use to write code.

## Terminal

Terminal, also known as command line or console, allow us to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a graphical user interface. Even if many tasks can be done interacting with the graphical user interface (like deleting or creating folders), there are some actions more recommended and faster to perform through the terminal, specially when working with Git (but we will see this on our next point).

On the course we will mainly use the integrated Terminal of our Visual Studio Code, but it's basically the same one than the Terminal you can find on your computer. We recommend you to have a basic understanding on how it works. You can take a look to this complete and fun-to-read [guide](https://medium.com/@grace.m.nolan/terminal-for-beginners-e492ba10902a). 

## Git and Github

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system. And what is this? A version control is any system that allows you to understand the history of a file and how it has progressed (a well-known example would be the Revision History of google drive documents).

[Github](https://github.com/) is the tool we use to share and upload our projects. You will need a Github account and a basic knowledge on how to use it. 

We recommend you to go through [this guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6) to understand how to work with both of them. Is a bit long but very complete, and you will get a good understanding on how to use them from scratch, and be able to use them during the course. 

This is the basic set up you will need for the first lesson. Continue to get the tools for the rest of the course.

## Node.js

On [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/) you can find the links for installing the latest version of Node.js on your machine. 

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. In an easier to understand explanation, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript, and is what we will use to create our applications on this course.

## MongoDB and Mongo Hub
